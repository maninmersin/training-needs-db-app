# Enterprise Change Management Platform - Claude Development Notes

## Overview
This system is evolving from a React-based training needs database application into a comprehensive enterprise change management platform. The current system helps organizations manage training schedules, courses, and user assignments, with a Training Schedule Creator (TSC) Wizard that generates calendar events for training sessions. 

**Current Evolution Status**: Database cleanup completed (2025-01-28). Stakeholder enhancement project initiated (2025-01-29) to align with industry best practices.

## Database Cleanup Initiative (2025-01-28)

### Overview
Major database schema standardization to establish consistent naming conventions and clean architecture before building stakeholder engagement capabilities.

### Current Database Issues

- Implement RAG status tracking (Red/Amber/Green)
- Add relationship management and contact tracking
- Provide advanced analytics and quadrant-based strategic recommendations

### Implementation Stages

#### Stage 1: Enhanced Database Schema Foundation ✅ COMPLETED (2025-01-29)
**Objective**: Establish new database structure with industry-standard fields

**Database Changes**:

  - Classification (category: Internal/External, priority: Primary/Secondary, type)
  - Power & Influence (1-5 scales instead of High/Medium/Low)
  - Engagement tracking (current 0-5, target 0-5, position on change)
  - Relationship management (owner, purpose, last contact date)
  - Status tracking (RAG status, actions required, comments)
- [x] Added comprehensive indexes for performance
- [x] Implemented RLS policies for project-based data isolation
- [x] Created utility functions (quadrant calculation, engagement descriptions)

- RAG status provides executive-level visibility into stakeholder health
- Relationship ownership ensures accountability
- Project-based isolation maintains data security

**Backward Compatibility Strategy**:
- Existing UI components continue to work during transition
- Service layer maintains same function signatures where possible
- New fields have sensible defaults to prevent breaking changes
- Migration approach allows stage-by-stage rollout

**Industry Standards Alignment**:
- Power/Interest matrix follows Mendelow's stakeholder analysis model
- Engagement levels align with ADKAR and Kotter change management frameworks
- RAG status reporting standard in project management
- Relationship ownership follows RACI accountability principles

### Next Steps
1. Execute the enhanced schema in Supabase database

## Training Course Assignment Architecture Redesign (2025-10-19)

### 📋 CURRENT STATUS: ON HOLD - AWAITING USER DECISION

**Project Status**: Planning completed, implementation paused for user evaluation
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-19
**Implementation Approach**: Parallel/Coexistence (Option A - safest for testing)

**What's Been Completed**:
- ✅ Comprehensive planning and architecture design
- ✅ Database schema created (`user_course_mappings_schema.sql`)
- ✅ Rollback strategy documented
- ✅ Parallel implementation approach defined
- ✅ User requirements clarified (Excel-first workflow)

**What's NOT Been Done Yet** (waiting for user go-ahead):
- ⏸️ Database schema deployment to Supabase
- ⏸️ Excel Import/Export component development
- ⏸️ UI tools (Individual Editor, Bulk Tool) development
- ⏸️ TSC Wizard parallel implementation
- ⏸️ Testing and validation

**Key Safety Guarantee**:
- ✅ **NO BREAKING CHANGES** - Role-based system remains fully functional
- ✅ **EASY ROLLBACK** - Can switch back anytime by restoring backup files
- ✅ **PARALLEL TESTING** - Both systems will work simultaneously during evaluation
- ✅ **NO DATABASE IMPACT** on existing role-based functionality

**User Action Required**:
When ready to proceed, user will decide whether to:
1. ✅ **Proceed with implementation** (deploy schema, build components)
2. ❌ **Cancel/postpone** (keep role-based system as-is)
3. 🔄 **Modify approach** (adjust requirements, timeline, or scope)

---

### Overview
Major architectural shift from role-based course assignment to individual-based course assignment in the Training Module. This change provides greater flexibility for organizations where training needs vary by individual rather than being standardized by job role.

**Backup Created**: ✅ System backup taken before planning phase
**Target Completion**: Phases 1-4 (Foundation, Excel Tools, TSC Integration, Testing) - 12-15 hours estimated

### Problem Statement

**Current System (Role-Based)**:
```
End Users → Project Roles → Role-Course Mappings → Courses
```
- Courses assigned to roles (e.g., "Store Manager" role gets Courses A, B, C)
- All users with that role automatically inherit those courses
- Managed via `RoleCourseMappingsEditor` component
- Uses `role_course_mappings` table

**Limitations**:
- ❌ No individual flexibility - everyone in same role gets same courses
- ❌ Cannot customize training for specific individuals
- ❌ No support for users needing courses outside their role
- ❌ Difficult to handle exceptions or special cases

**New System (Individual-Based)**:
```
End Users → User-Course Mappings → Courses
```
- Courses assigned directly to individual users
- Each person can have a unique course list
- Supports multiple courses per user
- Bulk operations available for efficiency

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Complete flexibility - each person can have unique training needs
- ✅ Support for exceptions and special cases
- ✅ Multiple courses per user
- ✅ Clear assignment audit trail (who assigned, when)
- ✅ No conflicts about where courses come from
- ✅ Still supports bulk operations for efficiency

### Current Architecture Analysis

**Database Tables**:
- `end_users` - Contains user information with `project_role` field
- `project_roles` - Role definitions (e.g., Store Manager, Assistant Manager)
- `role_course_mappings` - Maps roles to courses (role_name → course_id)
- `courses` - Course catalog

**Key Code Locations**:
- `src/shared/components/RoleCourseMappingsEditor.jsx` - Role-based assignment UI
- `src/modules/training/components/tsc-wizard/TSCFetchDataStage.jsx` - Fetches roles and courses (Line 21-36)
- `src/modules/training/components/tsc-wizard/TrainingCalculations.jsx` - Expects `user.course_id` (Line 52)
- `src/modules/training/components/tsc-wizard/TSCProcessDataStage.jsx` - Processes training sessions

**Critical Finding**:
Line 52 in `TrainingCalculations.jsx` shows:
```javascript
const attendees = usersInGroup.filter(user => user.course_id === course.course_id).length;
```
This already expects users to have `course_id` field! The current implementation fetches roles and expands them to users with courses, but the calculation logic is ready for individual mappings.

### New Architecture Design

#### Individual-Based Mapping (Primary Approach)

**Database Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_course_mappings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  project_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id),
  end_user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES end_users(id),
  course_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES courses(course_id),
  assigned_by TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'admin', 'manager', 'system', 'self'
  assigned_date TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(end_user_id, course_id) -- Prevent duplicate course assignments
);
```

**RLS Policies**:
- Project-based isolation (users can only see mappings for their projects)
- Manager-based access control (future: managers can only modify their team)

**Data Flow**:
1. Admin/Manager assigns courses to users via UI
2. Records stored in `user_course_mappings` table
3. TSC Wizard fetches `end_users` JOIN `user_course_mappings`
4. Each user has explicit list of assigned courses
5. Training calculations process individual course assignments

#### Hybrid Capability (Future Enhancement)

**Optional Role-Based Baseline**:
- Keep `role_course_mappings` table for optional baseline
- Add `mapping_type` field: 'add' | 'remove' | 'override'
- Individual mappings can add/remove from role baseline
- Individual assignments override role assignments

**Deferred to Phase 3**: Focus on pure individual-based system first.

### Implementation Strategy: Parallel/Coexistence Approach ⚠️ SAFETY FIRST

**Decision**: Option A - Build individual system in PARALLEL with role-based system
**Rationale**: Maximum safety and flexibility during testing phase
**Date Decided**: 2025-10-19

#### Why Parallel Implementation?

**Safety Considerations**:
- User has backup of working role-based system
- May want to switch back after testing
- Need to ensure no breaking changes during evaluation period
- Database changes should not interfere with rollback capability

#### Database Impact Analysis

**✅ SAFE - No Impact on Role-Based System:**
- ✅ Creating `user_course_mappings` table - completely separate, new table
- ✅ New RLS policies on `user_course_mappings` - only affect new table
- ✅ New helper functions (`get_user_courses`, `bulk_assign_courses`) - won't interfere
- ✅ Indexes on `user_course_mappings` - isolated to new table
- ✅ All existing tables remain untouched (`role_course_mappings`, `end_users`, etc.)

**⚠️ POTENTIAL CONFLICT - Requires Careful Implementation:**
- ⚠️ Changes to `TSCFetchDataStage.jsx` - must NOT break role-based workflow
- ⚠️ Changes to navigation/routing - must keep both options visible during testing
- ⚠️ New components should be ADDITIVE, not REPLACEMENTS

#### Rollback Strategy (If Individual System Not Suitable)

**Step 1: Database** - Simply stop using `user_course_mappings` table
- All existing tables remain functional
- New table can be dropped or left unused
- No data loss on role-based data

**Step 2: Code** - Restore backed-up files
- Restore `TSCFetchDataStage.jsx` to use `role_course_mappings`
- Restore navigation to primary `RoleCourseMappingsEditor`
- Remove/hide new individual-based components

**Step 3: Verify** - Test role-based workflow
- TSC Wizard generates schedules correctly
- Role-course mappings work as before
- No regression in existing functionality

### Implementation Phases (PARALLEL APPROACH)

#### Phase 1: Database Foundation ✅ COMPLETED (Schema Created)
**Goal**: Create individual course mapping table infrastructure WITHOUT affecting existing system

**Tasks**:
1. ✅ Create `user_course_mappings` table with proper schema
2. ✅ Add RLS policies for project-based isolation
3. ✅ Create indexes for performance (end_user_id, course_id, project_id)
4. ✅ Add created_at/updated_at triggers
5. ✅ Grant permissions to authenticated users
6. ✅ Create helper functions for common operations

**Database Changes**:
- ✅ New table: `user_course_mappings` (isolated, no dependencies)
- ✅ Keep existing: `end_users.project_role` (unchanged)
- ✅ Keep existing: `role_course_mappings` (fully functional, not deprecated yet)
- ✅ Keep existing: `project_roles` (unchanged)

**Files Created**:
- ✅ `user_course_mappings_schema.sql` - Complete database schema with all functions

**Deployment Status**: Schema ready but NOT YET deployed to Supabase (awaiting user decision)

**Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes

#### Phase 2: Excel Import/Export & Course Assignment Tools 📋 PLANNED (On Hold)
**Goal**: Enable bulk course assignment via Excel template, then build UI tools for ongoing changes

**Revised User Requirements (2025-10-19)**:
- **Initial Setup**: Bulk upload via Excel (this is how data will be initially collected)
- **Ongoing Changes**: Use system UI tools for amendments
- **Excel Template**: Generate template with all users and all courses for initial population

**Implementation Priority**:

**2A. Excel Template Generator & Import Wizard (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**:
- Component: `ImportExportUserCourseMappings.jsx`
- **Template Generation**:
  - Export Excel with all end_users (rows) and all courses (columns)
  - Wide format: Each course is a column, user marks with 'X' or checkmark
  - Include user metadata: ID, Name, Email, Role, Location
  - Include course metadata: CourseID, CourseName in header
  - Pre-formatted for easy bulk editing
- **Import Workflow**:
  - Upload completed Excel template
  - Validate structure (correct users, correct courses)
  - Parse checkmarks/X's to create user-course mappings
  - Batch insert into `user_course_mappings` table
  - Show import summary (X users, Y courses, Z total assignments)
  - Handle errors gracefully (invalid users, missing courses, etc.)

**Excel Format Decision**:
- **Wide Format** (one row per user, course columns) - chosen for intuitive bulk editing
  ```
  UserID | Name      | Email        | Role    | COURSE_A | COURSE_B | COURSE_C
  1      | John Doe  | john@ex.com  | Manager | X        | X        |
  2      | Mary Jane | mary@ex.com  | Staff   | X        |          | X
  ```

**2B. Individual User Course Editor (For Ongoing Changes)**:
- Component: `UserCourseMappingsEditor.jsx`
- Similar to `RoleCourseMappingsEditor` but for individual users
- Features:
  - Select one user from dropdown
  - View user's current course assignments
  - Add/remove courses via checkboxes
  - Show course details (functional area, duration, etc.)
  - Save/Cancel buttons
  - Assignment audit info (assigned by, date)

**2C. Bulk Course Assignment Tool (For Filtered Updates)**:
- Component: `BulkCourseAssignmentTool.jsx`
- Features:
  - Filter users by: project_role, training_location, department, name/email, existing courses
  - Multi-select sections for job roles and locations
  - Multi-select users (checkboxes or select all)
  - Multi-select courses (checkboxes or select all)
  - Preview mode: "Assigning 5 courses to 12 users"
  - Assignment mode toggle (user chooses each time):
    - ADD: Add courses to existing assignments (keeps current)
    - REPLACE: Clear existing, assign new courses
  - Bulk assign button with confirmation
  - Progress indicator for large operations
  - Success/failure results summary
  - Export capability (backup before changes)

**Files to Create**:
- `src/shared/components/ImportExportUserCourseMappings.jsx` (PRIORITY 1)
- `src/shared/components/ImportExportUserCourseMappings.css`
- `src/shared/components/UserCourseMappingsEditor.jsx` (PRIORITY 2)
- `src/shared/components/UserCourseMappingsEditor.css`
- `src/shared/components/BulkCourseAssignmentTool.jsx` (PRIORITY 3)
- `src/shared/components/BulkCourseAssignmentTool.css`

**Files to Update (PARALLEL APPROACH)**:
- Navigation: ADD new menu items alongside existing role-based options
- Routing: ADD new routes without removing old ones
- Keep `RoleCourseMappingsEditor` visible during testing phase

**Current Status**: ON HOLD - awaiting user decision to proceed
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours (Excel: 3-4hrs, Individual: 1-2hrs, Bulk: 2-3hrs)

#### Phase 3: TSC Wizard Integration 📋 PLANNED (Parallel Approach)
**Goal**: Create PARALLEL data fetching path - support BOTH role-based and individual-based mappings

**⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Do NOT break existing role-based workflow during testing

**Parallel Implementation Options**:

**Option 1: Feature Flag Approach**
```javascript
// TSCFetchDataStage.jsx
const USE_INDIVIDUAL_MAPPINGS = false; // Toggle for testing

if (USE_INDIVIDUAL_MAPPINGS) {
  // NEW: Fetch end_users JOIN user_course_mappings
} else {
  // EXISTING: Fetch project_roles with role_course_mappings
}
```

**Option 2: Duplicate Component Approach**
- Create `TSCFetchDataStage_Individual.jsx` (new version)
- Keep `TSCFetchDataStage.jsx` (original, untouched)
- Create `TSCWizard_Individual.jsx` or add wizard mode selector
- User chooses which wizard to use during testing

**Option 3: Runtime Selection**
- Add UI toggle in TSC Wizard: "Use Individual Course Assignments" checkbox
- Single component, runtime branching based on user selection
- Allows side-by-side comparison

**Recommended**: Option 2 (safest, clearest separation)

**Components to Update/Create**:

**3A. TSCFetchDataStage_Individual.jsx (NEW FILE)**:
```javascript
// NEW (Individual-Based):
- Fetch end_users from current project
- JOIN user_course_mappings ON end_user_id
- Return users with their assigned courses
- Data structure: { courses, end_users: usersWithCourses }
```

**3B. TrainingCalculations.jsx**:
- NO CHANGES NEEDED (already expects `user.course_id`)
- Works with both data sources
- Handles users with multiple courses

**3C. TSCProcessDataStage.jsx**:
- NO CHANGES NEEDED
- Processes user-course data regardless of source

**3D. Navigation/Wizard Launcher**:
- Add "TSC Wizard (Individual Mappings)" menu item
- Keep "TSC Wizard (Role-Based)" menu item
- Both visible during testing phase

**Files to Create**:
- `src/modules/training/components/tsc-wizard/TSCFetchDataStage_Individual.jsx` (new)
- `src/modules/training/components/tsc-wizard/TSCWizard_Individual.jsx` (wrapper/router)

**Files to Keep Unchanged**:
- `src/modules/training/components/tsc-wizard/TSCFetchDataStage.jsx` (UNTOUCHED)
- `src/modules/training/components/tsc-wizard/TrainingCalculations.jsx` (UNTOUCHED)
- `src/modules/training/components/tsc-wizard/TSCProcessDataStage.jsx` (UNTOUCHED)
- `src/modules/training/components/tsc-wizard/TSCWizard.jsx` (UNTOUCHED)

**Testing Strategy**:
1. Test role-based wizard (ensure still works)
2. Test individual-based wizard (new functionality)
3. Compare results side-by-side
4. User decides which approach to keep

**Current Status**: ON HOLD - awaiting user decision to proceed
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours (mostly copying and adapting fetch logic)

#### Phase 4: Testing & Validation 📋 PLANNED
**Goal**: Comprehensive testing of BOTH systems to ensure parallel operation

**Test Cases (Role-Based System - Regression Testing)**:
1. ✅ Role-course mappings still work (RoleCourseMappingsEditor)
2. ✅ TSC Wizard (original) generates schedules correctly
3. ✅ Training sessions created with role-based assignments
4. ✅ Calendar events work as before
5. ✅ No console errors or breaking changes

**Test Cases (Individual-Based System - New Functionality)**:
1. Excel template generation (all users, all courses)
2. Excel import with validation
3. Individual course assignment (UserCourseMappingsEditor)
4. Bulk course assignment (add mode)
5. Bulk course assignment (replace mode)
6. TSC Wizard (individual) generates schedules correctly
7. Training session generation with individual mappings
8. Calendar event creation
9. User filtering in bulk tool (role, location, multiple criteria)
10. Assignment audit trail (who assigned, when)
11. RLS policies (project isolation)
12. Error handling and edge cases

**Comparison Testing**:
- Same users, same courses, different assignment methods
- Compare TSC Wizard outputs (should be identical results)
- Performance comparison (role-based vs individual queries)

**Files to Update**:
- Update CLAUDE.md with final decision
- Document chosen approach
- Update user guides (if any)

**Current Status**: ON HOLD - awaiting user decision to proceed
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

**TOTAL ESTIMATED TIME (Phases 1-4)**: 12-15 hours

#### Phase 5: Manager Portal (DEFERRED)
**Status**: 🔮 FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
**Decision Point**: After Phase 1-2 completion

**Planned Features**:
- Manager-specific course assignment portal
- View only direct reports
- Assign/remove courses for team members
- Manager-based RLS policies
- Approval workflows
- Team training dashboard

**Prerequisites**:
- Add `manager_id` field to `end_users` table
- Create manager assignment UI
- Implement manager-based RLS policies
- Add "Manager" role to auth system

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours (when implemented)

### Key Design Decisions

#### Decision 1: Individual-Only vs Hybrid
**Chosen**: Individual-Only (with bulk operations)
**Rationale**:
- Avoids conflicts between role and individual assignments
- Simpler to understand and maintain
- Clear source of truth
- Bulk operations provide efficiency without complexity
- User's concern: "would I end up with courses that are for their role but I removed for the individual?"

#### Decision 2: Keep Role Field
**Chosen**: Keep `end_users.project_role` field
**Rationale**:
- Used for filtering/grouping in bulk operations
- Organizational reference (not used for course assignment)
- Helps with reporting and analytics
- No need to restructure existing data

#### Decision 3: Role-Course Mappings Table (REVISED 2025-10-19)
**Chosen**: Keep table AND functionality during parallel testing
**Rationale**:
- ⚠️ PARALLEL APPROACH: Both systems will coexist during evaluation
- User may want to rollback to role-based system after testing
- No harm in keeping both approaches active
- DO NOT hide `RoleCourseMappingsEditor` - keep visible alongside new tools
- Final deprecation decision AFTER testing phase

#### Decision 4: Multiple Courses Per User
**Chosen**: Support unlimited courses per user
**Rationale**:
- Real-world requirement
- Separate records in `user_course_mappings` (one per user-course pair)
- Easy to query and manage
- Supports complex training scenarios

#### Decision 5: Assignment Audit Trail
**Chosen**: Track who assigned and when
**Rationale**:
- Accountability and transparency
- Debugging and support
- Future manager portal needs this
- Regulatory/compliance requirements

### Database Schema Changes

#### New Table: user_course_mappings

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_course_mappings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  project_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  end_user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES end_users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  course_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES courses(course_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  assigned_by TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'admin', -- 'admin', 'manager', 'system', 'self'
  assigned_date TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  CONSTRAINT unique_user_course UNIQUE(end_user_id, course_id)
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_user_course_mappings_project_id ON user_course_mappings(project_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_course_mappings_end_user_id ON user_course_mappings(end_user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_course_mappings_course_id ON user_course_mappings(course_id);

-- RLS Policies
ALTER TABLE user_course_mappings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view mappings for their projects" ON user_course_mappings
  FOR SELECT USING (
    project_id IN (
      SELECT pu.project_id FROM project_users pu
      WHERE pu.user_id = auth.uid() AND pu.is_active = true
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert mappings for their projects" ON user_course_mappings
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    project_id IN (
      SELECT pu.project_id FROM project_users pu
      WHERE pu.user_id = auth.uid() AND pu.is_active = true
      AND pu.role IN ('owner', 'admin', 'member')
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can update mappings for their projects" ON user_course_mappings
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    project_id IN (
      SELECT pu.project_id FROM project_users pu
      WHERE pu.user_id = auth.uid() AND pu.is_active = true
      AND pu.role IN ('owner', 'admin', 'member')
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete mappings for their projects" ON user_course_mappings
  FOR DELETE USING (
    project_id IN (
      SELECT pu.project_id FROM project_users pu
      WHERE pu.user_id = auth.uid() AND pu.is_active = true
      AND pu.role IN ('owner', 'admin', 'member')
    )
  );

-- Updated timestamp trigger
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_user_course_mappings_updated_at()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.updated_at = NOW();
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER user_course_mappings_updated_at
  BEFORE UPDATE ON user_course_mappings
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_user_course_mappings_updated_at();

-- Grant permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON user_course_mappings TO authenticated;
```

#### Existing Tables: No Changes Required

**end_users** - Keep as is:
- `project_role` field retained for filtering/organization
- No structural changes needed

**courses** - No changes
**project_roles** - No changes
**role_course_mappings** - Deprecated but kept

- Export results option

### TSC Wizard Updates

#### Current Flow (Role-Based):
```javascript
// TSCFetchDataStage.jsx
1. Fetch courses from 'courses' table
2. Fetch project_roles from 'project_roles' table
3. Set schedulesList: { courses, end_users: projectRoles }
4. Pass to next stage

// TrainingCalculations.jsx
5. Expects users to have course_id field
6. Filters: user.course_id === course.course_id
7. Generates training sessions
```

#### New Flow (Individual-Based):
```javascript
// TSCFetchDataStage.jsx
1. Fetch courses from 'courses' table
2. Fetch end_users with their course assignments:
   SELECT end_users.*, user_course_mappings.course_id
   FROM end_users
   LEFT JOIN user_course_mappings ON end_users.id = user_course_mappings.end_user_id
   WHERE end_users.project_id = current_project_id
3. Set schedulesList: { courses, end_users: usersWithCourses }
4. Pass to next stage

// TrainingCalculations.jsx
5. No changes needed - already expects user.course_id
6. Filters: user.course_id === course.course_id
7. Generates training sessions
```

**Key Changes**:
- Replace `project_roles` fetch with `end_users + user_course_mappings` join
- Data structure remains compatible
- TrainingCalculations already expects this format!

### Migration Strategy

**No Migration Needed**:
- System is just starting out
- No existing `role_course_mappings` data to convert
- Fresh start with individual mappings

**Deprecation Plan**:
- Keep `role_course_mappings` table (for historical reference)
- Hide `RoleCourseMappingsEditor` from navigation
- Update documentation to reflect new approach

### Outstanding Questions (Need User Input)

#### Question 1: Navigation/Menu Placement
Where should the new course assignment tools appear?
- **Option A**: Reference Data / Setup section (alongside courses, users)
- **Option B**: New top-level "Course Assignment" menu
- **Option C**: Training module submenu
- **Recommended**: Option A (keeps related functions together)

#### Question 2: Bulk Assignment Default Behavior
When bulk assigning courses to users:
- **Option A**: ADD - Add courses to existing assignments (keep current courses)
- **Option B**: REPLACE - Clear existing, assign only selected courses
- **Option C**: ASK - User chooses mode each time (toggle)
- **Recommended**: Option C (maximum flexibility)

#### Question 3: Bulk Tool Filter Options
Which filters should be available in bulk assignment tool?
- ✅ Project Role (definite)
- ✅ Training Location (definite)
- ✅ Name/Email search (definite)
- ❓ Department (if field exists)
- ❓ Functional Area (if relevant)
- ❓ Custom attributes (extensible)

#### Question 4: Course Assignment Permissions
Who can assign courses to users?
- **Current Assumption**: Anyone with project access (owner, admin, member)
- **Future**: Manager-specific permissions (Phase 5)

### Success Criteria

#### Phase 1-2 Complete When:
- ✅ `user_course_mappings` table created and tested
- ✅ RLS policies working correctly
- ✅ Individual course assignment tool functional
- ✅ Bulk course assignment tool functional
- ✅ Users can be assigned multiple courses

- ✅ Training sessions generated correctly
- ✅ No regressions in existing functionality
- ✅ Documentation updated

#### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Create individual user course assignment
- [ ] Update individual user course assignment
- [ ] Delete individual user course assignment
- [ ] Bulk assign courses (add mode)
- [ ] Bulk assign courses (replace mode)
- [ ] Filter users in bulk tool
- [ ] TSC Wizard fetches user-course data

- [ ] Calendar events created successfully
- [ ] Project isolation (can't see other projects' data)
- [ ] Error handling (missing data, network errors)
- [ ] Performance with large datasets (100+ users, 50+ courses)

### Rollback Plan

**If Issues Arise**:
1. User has backup of working system ✅
2. Can revert database changes:
   - Drop `user_course_mappings` table
   - Restore navigation to show `RoleCourseMappingsEditor`
   - Revert TSCFetchDataStage changes
3. No data loss (system just starting, no production data)

### Next Steps (After Break)

1. **Answer Outstanding Questions** (navigation, bulk behavior, filters)
2. **Phase 1**: Create database schema script
3. **Phase 2**: Build Individual Course Editor UI
4. **Phase 2**: Build Bulk Course Assignment Tool
5. **Phase 3**: Update TSC Wizard data fetching
6. **Phase 4**: Comprehensive testing
7. **Decision Point**: Proceed with Phase 5 (Manager Portal) or defer
