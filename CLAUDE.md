# Enterprise Change Management Platform - Claude Development Notes

## Overview
This system is evolving from a React-based training needs database application into a comprehensive enterprise change management platform. The current system helps organizations manage training schedules, courses, and user assignments, with a Training Schedule Creator (TSC) Wizard that generates calendar events for training sessions. 

**Current Evolution Status**: Database cleanup completed (2025-01-28). Stakeholder enhancement project initiated (2025-01-29) to align with industry best practices.

## Database Cleanup Initiative (2025-01-28)

### Overview
Major database schema standardization to establish consistent naming conventions and clean architecture before building stakeholder engagement capabilities.

### Current Database Issues
- Mixed naming conventions (a_ prefixes, _tbl suffixes, inconsistent pluralization)
- Duplicate tables (users vs a_users, etc.)
- Inconsistent organization across functional areas

### Cleanup Phases & Progress

## Stakeholder Management Enhancement Project (2025-01-29)

### Overview
Complete redesign of the stakeholder management system to align with industry best practices and change management standards. Based on established stakeholder analysis templates and proven frameworks.

### Enhancement Goals
- Replace High/Medium/Low scales with granular 1-5 scales for power and interest
- Add comprehensive engagement tracking (current vs target levels)
- Implement RAG status tracking (Red/Amber/Green)
- Add relationship management and contact tracking
- Provide advanced analytics and quadrant-based strategic recommendations

### Implementation Stages

#### Stage 1: Enhanced Database Schema Foundation ✅ COMPLETED (2025-01-29)
**Objective**: Establish new database structure with industry-standard fields

**Database Changes**:
- [x] Dropped existing stakeholder tables (stakeholders, stakeholder_categories, stakeholder_relationships)
- [x] Created enhanced stakeholders table with new schema:
  - Basic information (name, title, department, organization, contact)
  - Classification (category: Internal/External, priority: Primary/Secondary, type)
  - Power & Influence (1-5 scales instead of High/Medium/Low)
  - Engagement tracking (current 0-5, target 0-5, position on change)
  - Relationship management (owner, purpose, last contact date)
  - Status tracking (RAG status, actions required, comments)
- [x] Added comprehensive indexes for performance
- [x] Implemented RLS policies for project-based data isolation
- [x] Created utility functions (quadrant calculation, engagement descriptions)
- [x] Added validation functions with enhanced field validation

**Service Layer Updates**:
- [x] Completely rebuilt stakeholderService.js with enhanced functionality:
  - Enhanced CRUD operations with new fields and calculated properties
  - Advanced search and filtering capabilities
  - Comprehensive analytics and statistics
  - Helper functions for descriptions and color coding
  - Robust validation for all new field constraints

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ Database schema created successfully
- ✅ Service layer functions operational
- ✅ Existing UI components load without errors (backward compatible)
- ✅ Ready for Stage 2 form enhancements

**Files Modified**:
- `stakeholder_schema_enhanced.sql` (new file)
- `src/modules/stakeholders/services/stakeholderService.js` (complete rewrite)
- `CLAUDE.md` (documentation update)

#### Stage 2: Basic Form Enhancement (PLANNED)
**Objective**: Update StakeholderForm with new fields while maintaining single-tab design

**Planned Changes**:
- [ ] Add 1-5 sliders for power and interest levels with descriptions
- [ ] Add engagement level selectors (current and target)
- [ ] Add RAG status selection with visual indicators
- [ ] Add relationship owner selection
- [ ] Add stakeholder category and priority dropdowns
- [ ] Update form validation for new constraints
- [ ] Test form submission with enhanced data

#### Stage 3: Enhanced Directory & Analytics (PLANNED)
**Objective**: Update directory display and add basic analytics

**Planned Changes**:
- [ ] Update StakeholderDirectory table columns with new fields
- [ ] Add filtering for power/interest levels and RAG status
- [ ] Create basic analytics dashboard showing distributions
- [ ] Add visual indicators for engagement gaps and overdue contacts
- [ ] Test end-to-end functionality

#### Stage 4: Reference Data Management (PLANNED)
**Objective**: Make dropdown options customizable per project

**Planned Changes**:
- [ ] Create StakeholderReferenceDataManager component
- [ ] Add reference data tables for customizable dropdowns
- [ ] Update forms to use dynamic dropdown data

**Objective**: Implement sophisticated stakeholder management capabilities

**Planned Changes**:
- [ ] Multi-tab form design with enhanced UX
- [ ] Advanced analytics with quadrant analysis
- [ ] Communication tracking and planning
- [ ] Stakeholder journey visualization
- [ ] Executive reporting and dashboards

### Key Technical Decisions

**Database Design Philosophy**:
- Granular 1-5 scales provide better differentiation than High/Medium/Low
- Separate current vs target engagement enables gap analysis and goal setting
- RAG status provides executive-level visibility into stakeholder health
- Relationship ownership ensures accountability
- Project-based isolation maintains data security

**Backward Compatibility Strategy**:
- Existing UI components continue to work during transition
- Service layer maintains same function signatures where possible
- New fields have sensible defaults to prevent breaking changes
- Migration approach allows stage-by-stage rollout

**Industry Standards Alignment**:
- Power/Interest matrix follows Mendelow's stakeholder analysis model
- Engagement levels align with ADKAR and Kotter change management frameworks
- RAG status reporting standard in project management
- Relationship ownership follows RACI accountability principles

### Next Steps
1. Execute the enhanced schema in Supabase database
2. Test basic CRUD operations with new fields
3. Proceed to Stage 2: Form enhancement
4. Continue systematic staged rollout
