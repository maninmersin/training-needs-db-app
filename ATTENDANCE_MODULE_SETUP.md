The Attendance Module is a comprehensive system for tracking and managing attendance for training sessions. It integrates seamlessly with the existing training management platform and provides trainers with powerful tools to mark attendance, manage session attendees, and generate detailed reports.

## Features Implemented

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Features
- **Real-time Attendance Tracking** - Mark attendance with multiple status options (Present, Absent, Late, Excused, Partial)
- **Session Management** - Register/remove attendees for training sessions
- **Comprehensive Reporting** - Analytics dashboard with statistics and export capabilities
- **Mobile-Responsive Design** - Optimized for trainers using tablets/mobile devices
- **Project-Based Isolation** - All data is isolated by project for security

### ðŸ“Š Components Created
1. **AttendanceTracker** - Main interface for marking attendance during sessions
2. **SessionAttendanceManager** - Manage attendee registration and session setup
3. **AttendanceReports** - Analytics dashboard with statistics and export functionality

## Database Schema

### Tables Created
```sql
-- Attendance status lookup table
attendance_statuses (
  id, status_name, status_description, is_present, 
  color_code, display_order, is_active, created_at
)

-- Session attendee registration
session_attendees (
  id, project_id, session_id, attendee_id, 
  registered_at, registered_by, is_confirmed, 
  waitlist_position, notes, created_at, updated_at
)

-- Actual attendance records
attendance_records (
  id, project_id, session_id, attendee_id, trainer_id,
  attendance_status_id, check_in_time, check_out_time,
  actual_duration_minutes, notes, private_notes,
  marked_at, marked_by, created_at, updated_at
)
```

### Database Functions
- `get_session_attendance_summary()` - Calculate attendance statistics
- `bulk_register_attendees()` - Register multiple attendees at once
- `bulk_mark_attendance()` - Mark attendance for multiple people
- Triggers for `updated_at` timestamp management

## Installation Steps

### 1. Database Setup
Execute the database schema in your Supabase/PostgreSQL database:
```bash
psql -h your-db-host -d your-db-name -f attendance_schema.sql
```

### 2. Dependencies
The module uses existing dependencies:
- React Router for navigation
- Existing authentication system
- Project context for data isolation
- XLSX library for exports (already installed)

### 3. Navigation Integration
âœ… **Already Completed**: Added "Attendance Management" section to training sidebar with three menu items:
- Attendance Tracker
- Session Manager  
- Reports & Analytics

### 4. Route Integration
âœ… **Already Completed**: Added routes to App.jsx:
- `/attendance-tracker`
- `/session-attendance-manager`
- `/attendance-reports`

## Usage Guide

### For Trainers

#### Marking Attendance
1. Navigate to **Attendance Tracker**
2. Select the training session from the grid
3. View registered attendees and mark their status:
   - **Present** (Green) - Full attendance
   - **Late** (Yellow) - Arrived late but attended
   - **Partial** (Orange) - Left early or attended partially
   - **Absent** (Red) - Did not attend
   - **Excused** (Gray) - Absent with valid reason

#### Managing Session Attendees
1. Navigate to **Session Manager**
2. Select a session from the sidebar
3. Add/remove attendees as needed
4. View session capacity and registration status

#### Viewing Reports
1. Navigate to **Reports & Analytics**
2. Use filters to narrow down data
3. View overall statistics and functional area breakdowns
4. Export data to Excel or CSV formats

### For Administrators

#### Setting up Sessions
1. Ensure training sessions are created via existing Schedule Manager
2. Sessions automatically appear in the attendance system
3. Register attendees using the Session Manager

#### Managing Attendance Statuses
The system comes with 5 default statuses, but these can be customized in the database:
```sql
-- Add custom attendance status
INSERT INTO attendance_statuses (
  status_name, status_description, is_present, color_code, display_order
) VALUES (
  'Medical Leave', 'Absent due to medical reasons', false, '#6f42c1', 6
);
```

## Architecture & Technical Details

### Service Layer
**Location**: `src/modules/training/services/attendanceService.js`

Key functions:
- `getAttendanceStatuses()` - Fetch available status options
- `getSessionsForAttendance()` - Load sessions for attendance tracking
- `markSingleAttendance()` / `markBulkAttendance()` - Record attendance
- `getAttendanceStatistics()` - Calculate reporting statistics
- `exportAttendanceData()` - Generate export data

### Component Architecture
```
src/modules/training/components/attendance/
â”œâ”€â”€ AttendanceTracker.jsx - Main trainer interface
â”œâ”€â”€ AttendanceTracker.css
â”œâ”€â”€ SessionAttendanceManager.jsx - Attendee management
â”œâ”€â”€ SessionAttendanceManager.css  
â”œâ”€â”€ AttendanceReports.jsx - Analytics dashboard
â””â”€â”€ AttendanceReports.css
```

### Data Flow
1. **Training Sessions** created via existing Schedule Manager
2. **Attendees registered** via Session Attendance Manager
3. **Attendance marked** via Attendance Tracker during sessions
4. **Reports generated** via Attendance Reports with real-time statistics

### Security & Permissions
- **Project-based isolation** - Users only see data for their assigned projects
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all attendance tables
- **Audit trail** - All attendance records include who marked them and when
- **Role-based access** - Leverages existing authentication system

## Customization Options

### Attendance Statuses
Modify the `attendance_statuses` table to add custom status types:
```sql
UPDATE attendance_statuses 
SET color_code = '#your-color' 
WHERE status_name = 'Present';
```

### UI Customization
- Color schemes can be modified in the CSS files
- Status colors are pulled from the database for consistency
- Mobile breakpoints can be adjusted in CSS media queries

### Reporting Filters
Add new filter options by modifying:
- `AttendanceReports.jsx` - Add new filter controls
- `attendanceService.js` - Update `getAttendanceStatistics()` function

## Mobile Optimization

The attendance module is fully optimized for mobile devices:
- **Responsive Grid Layouts** - Adapt to screen sizes
- **Touch-Friendly Buttons** - Large tap targets for status selection
- **Collapsible Tables** - Stack columns on mobile
- **Quick Actions** - Swipe-friendly interfaces

## Export Capabilities

### Available Export Formats
- **Excel (.xlsx)** - Full formatting with proper column types
- **CSV (.csv)** - Universal format for external systems

### Export Data Includes
- Attendee details (name, email, job title, division)
- Session information (course, date, location, functional area)
- Attendance status and timing
- Notes and marking details
- Full audit trail

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- **Indexes** created on frequently queried columns
- **Composite indexes** for multi-column searches
- **Foreign key constraints** maintain data integrity

### Frontend Optimization
- **Lazy loading** for large attendee lists
- **Debounced search** prevents excessive API calls
- **Cached attendance statuses** reduce repeated queries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. No sessions appearing in Attendance Tracker**
- Verify sessions exist in `training_sessions` table
- Check user has project access via `project_users` table
- Confirm sessions have future dates or are marked as active

**2. Cannot mark attendance**
- Ensure attendees are registered for the session
- Verify user permissions in the project
- Check attendance status records in database

**3. Export not working**
- Verify XLSX library is properly installed
- Check browser popup blockers
- Ensure user has sufficient project permissions

### Database Queries for Debugging

```sql
-- Check session attendance setup
SELECT s.course_name, s.start_datetime, 
       COUNT(sa.id) as registered_attendees,
       COUNT(ar.id) as attendance_marked
FROM training_sessions s
LEFT JOIN session_attendees sa ON s.id = sa.session_id
LEFT JOIN attendance_records ar ON s.id = ar.session_id
WHERE s.project_id = 'your-project-id'
GROUP BY s.id, s.course_name, s.start_datetime
ORDER BY s.start_datetime;

-- Check attendance statistics
SELECT ast.status_name, COUNT(ar.id) as count
FROM attendance_records ar
JOIN attendance_statuses ast ON ar.attendance_status_id = ast.id
WHERE ar.project_id = 'your-project-id'
GROUP BY ast.status_name, ast.display_order
ORDER BY ast.display_order;
```

## Future Enhancements
