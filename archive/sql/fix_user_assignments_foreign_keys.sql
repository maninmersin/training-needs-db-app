-- Fix user_assignments foreign key constraints
-- Drop the end_users foreign key since we're using flat table approach (training_data)

-- 1. Check current foreign key constraints
SELECT
    tc.constraint_name,
    tc.table_name,
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
  ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
  AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
  ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
  AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
  AND tc.table_name = 'user_assignments';

-- 2. Drop the foreign key constraint to end_users (not using end_users table)
ALTER TABLE user_assignments
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS user_assignments_end_user_id_fkey;

-- 3. Also drop the foreign key to session_id if it exists and is causing issues
-- (we're using session_identifier instead)
ALTER TABLE user_assignments
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS user_assignments_session_id_fkey;

-- 4. Verify constraints were dropped
SELECT
    tc.constraint_name,
    tc.table_name,
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
  ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
  AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
  ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
  AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
  AND tc.table_name = 'user_assignments';
